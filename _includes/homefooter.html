<h2>About</h2>
<p>Mission Cleaners Books is a publisher of poetry. Mission Cleaners Books was founded in 2012 by Elliot Harmon. Reading a book from Mission Cleaners Books is like slipping on an old coat from Goodwill that you had a new lining sewn into at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-cleaners-san-francisco" target="_blank">Mission Cleaners</a>: it brims with roughness and history but feels unexpectedly cozy on the inside.</p>
